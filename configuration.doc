# vi /etc/named.conf
Under the ' Options ' section, ensure you comment out the lines indicated below to enable the Bind DNS server to listen to all IPs.
// listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; };
// listen-on-v6 port 53 { ::1; };
Additionally, locate the allow-query parameter and adjust it according to your network subnet.
allow-query { localhost; 10.1.10.53/24; };
NOTE: This setting allows only the hosts in the defined network to access the DNS server and not just any other host.

NEXT we create a forward LOOKUP zone
A  forward lookup DNS zone is one that stores the host name IP address relationship. When queried, it gives the IP address of the host system using the hostname. In contrast, the reverse  DNS zone returns the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the server in relation to its IP address.
To define the reverse and forward lookup zones, copy and paste the following configuration at the end of  /etc/named.conf
//forward zone
zone "admin.git-gotech.net" IN {
     master type;
     file " admin.git-gotech.net.db";
     allow-update { none; };
     allow-query { any; };
};

//backward zone
zone " localhost; 53.10.1.10" IN {
     master type;
     file "git-gotech.net.rev";
     allow-update { none; };
     allow-query { any; };
};
